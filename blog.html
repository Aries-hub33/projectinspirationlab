 1) Arish:
 <hr>I came up with the name of the company as “Night Crave” and did some research over food delivery website. Tried to install adobe spark and tried to design a logo for the company. But Justin came up with the logo and It was really fascinating and we agreed to use that logo. The skills required for this is basically researching so It counts on technical. Like I went through different websites and gained ideas. What makes our company unique is that It delivers you at night for people who are running out of foods and don't want to go outside. We deliver right at their doorstep for their convenient. The difficulties that I encounter doing was trying to make the logo. As, It was my first time using adobe spark but maybe for my professional life later on I will learn to make a better logo. Even though we didn’t choose the logo we created. I will be solving these difficulties by watching some tutorials about adobe spark to make a perfect logo. <hr/>
